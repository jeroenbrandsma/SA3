\chapter{Hardware Architecture}
\label{ch:hardware}
This section describes the hardware architecture of SFM. The description will be more high-level along with explanations about the hardware platform and the application interfaces between each components of the system. The rest of this chapter is organized as follows; First section, \autoref{sec:hardware-overview}, presents an overview of the hardware implemented in this system depicted in big schema. Decisions made in this system are detailed in \autoref{sec:hardware-decisions} with tables. Lastly, the hardware is described in \autoref{sec:hardware-description}.
