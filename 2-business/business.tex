\section{Business vision}
The Smart Flood Monitor will cause a revolutionary innovation on the environmental monitoring market. \CompanyName will offer a system which can detect floods early and correctly. This system helps us to enforce our vision, to limit the social and financial consequences of floods and avoid the loss of human lives. 

\CompanyName will not be the only competitor on the environmental monitoring market. This means \CompanyName will have to take their own strength and weaknesses into account.
