\section{Evolution requirements}

%\label{subsec:evolrequir}

%Typical change-cases with respect to the environement, the features and the technology of the system
%http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/changeCase.htm
When establishing the project, architects of the system listed a certain number of requirements which describe the features of the system. However, due to environmental changes and changing stakeholders' interests for example, the requirements may evolve.

%\textbf{ER-1 : Changes in the display of the map } \\
%\textit { Evolution of \ref{fr:construct-map}}. Citizens who subscribed for flood warnings get a map with specific route information (according to their location) to a safe area through the API. \\

\textbf{Change case}: Earthquakes should also be detected by the system. \\
\textbf{Likelihood}: Very likely, in the northern part of the Netherlands earthquakes are already happening. \\ 
\textbf{Impact}:  Large. Different sensors and algorithms would be needed to detect the earthquakes. \\


\textbf{Change case}: The LoRa network technology has sufficient coverage to use it for sending sensor data. \\
\textbf{Likelihood}: High, KPN is already working on this. Also, an initiative of The Things Network, is increasing the coverage in the Netherlands. Eventually, this network will have sufficient coverage. \\
\textbf{Impact}: The Arduinos should be changed so they can send the data via the LoRa network, the cables become obsolete, and powering via solar energy becomes a possibility. \\


\textbf{Change case}: The safety board also wants the system to automatically trigger the civil defense siren. \\
\textbf{Likelihood}: Low, the safety board can trigger the siren themselves and the government is considering to stop using this system by 2018.\cite{luchtalarm}. Maybe in the future, the keep using the system. \\
\textbf{Impact}: Low. The warning part of the system can be connected to the civil defense siren, without affecting other parts of the system.

% \textbf{ER-1 : Adding of external input}\\
%  Citizens can contribute to the guidance by giving extra information (for example if they identified a safe route near their location). This information can be checked by an operator (thanks to photograph by the UAVs for example). 
 
%  Functionality can be added to the system in the future, that can take citizen feedback into account for the flood prediction.
%  \\
 
% \textbf{ER-2 : New sensors } The system is able to work with new sensors technologies, which are coming on the market over the years. \\

% \textbf{ER-3 : Improved algorithms for detecting a flood} \\
% New algorithms may become available, which have a better accuracy for the flood prediction described in \ref{fr:detect-flood}. The part of the system with the flood prediction algorithm has to be modular, so that it can be replaced with an improved algorithm, once such an algorithm becomes available.
