\chapter{Architectural business information}
\label{ch:business}
The following section describes the different aspects of the business environment of the Smart Flood Monitor. First we will explain our vision and why there is place for us at the market.
 
After this the product and its stakeholders will be explained. This chapter is completed with a more detailed look at the business model and some models about the market and the financial prospect.

\section{Business opportunity}
There are many natural disasters happening each year all over the world. Each year these disasters take lives, destroys a lot of properties, and cause social disturbance.
Looking at, for example, the Indian ocean's tsunami in 2004, it looks that the damage could have been significantly reduced if the necessary people were warned\cite{tsunami10ylater, tsunamiwarnsavelives}.  %\We should add a reference here

In the future more floods are expected because of global warming\cite{climateincrease}. The rise of the sea level is a consequence of global warming. Another consequence is the increase of extreme weather events, for instance heavy rainfall. It is expected that natural disasters will cause 300 billion in losses annually in the upcoming decade\cite{disastercosts}. This justifies to invest a high amount of money to minor the losses of a flood. Not only the losses in terms of money, but more importantly lives, and also social impact.

A next generation reliable flood monitoring and warning system will help lower the catastrophic impact of floods. The system will imminent floods and send out people in order to reduce the impact of a flood. In the future the system should be able to monitor other kinds of disasters and send out warnings. 

The Netherlands is a country that is situated for large parts(26\%) under the sea level\cite{holland}. Using dikes and other solutions they protect their country against the water. The increasing sea level causes extreme danger in the Netherlands. It is important that they can monitor how dangerous imminent floods are and take action if things are looking to wrong. If things go wrong people within the area should be warned in order to take action and safe their self, others, and their belongings.

\section{Mission statement}
A flood monitoring and warning system helps us to enforce our vision, to limit the social and financial consequences of floods and reduce the loss of human lives. \\
The Smart Flood Monitor will cause a revolutionary innovation on the environmental monitoring market. \CompanyName{} will be able to offer a system that can detect floods early and correctly by using the newest available techniques.

\section{Business rationale}
\CompanyName{} will develop a new flood warning system in order to minimize the damage caused by a flood. As said before, in the Netherlands protection against floods is an important issue, because a major part of the Netherlands itself is actually below sea level. Global warming will increase the urgency of this issue. The people within the Netherlands must be well protected against floods. The flood warning system will detect floods, warn people and governmental institutions located in the disaster area and provide guidance where to go to. This visualized in the figure below.

\CompanyName{} is new within the flood warning system market. By using sensors and automated systems, a reliable and adequate product that uses the newest technologies will be launched. \CompanyName{} will use hardware which is already on the market and is tested. Buying third party hardware will also speedup the development of the system and lower the costs.

The product price will be low in order to get a market share and prove the product in a real-time environment. By providing maintenance and updates in the future \CompanyName{} will earn money to improve the product further and sell it to other potential customers. This in combination with the increasing need of a reliable warning system for imminent floods will result in a viable business.


The unique selling points of our system are: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item To provide a system with low selling price and high profit from the service contracts and upgrades
	\item Warn the people in and around the area as soon as possible if the system is very certain that a flood is or will happen
	\item Inform the necessary parties about the details of the flood so the right preparations are made. 
	\item Inform people how to save themselves, how to save other people or how to save valuable goods
\end{itemize}

%People who requested it, will get informed on how to prepare for the flood and what to do during the flood.\\
This way, people will know when an area gets flooded, or when it is about to happen. 
These are unique features for our system, which will eventually make the system successful. The main goal of this project, however, is to safe lives, reduce costs and reduce social consequences. These main goals will be met when:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item 80\% of the people in a dangerous area regarding a flood, receive a warning message. This message must contain enough information for receivers to know whether they are save or not and if not, how they can get to a save location.
	\item 80\% of the people who receive a warning successfully get to a safe environment in time.
	\item 80\% of the people receiving information before or during a flood, find these messages helpful and reported that it guided them successfully in order to save extra lives and/or goods.
\end{enumerate}

When the first version of \ProjectName{} is released and is used to start monitoring actual floods, its success will be measured according these statistics. Getting a warning message to the people who requested to be warned is the most important thing to do. Using this warning message, people can move to a saver location.


\section{Product and service description}
\CompanyName{} offers a flood warning system. When a imminent flood is monitored by the sensors of the system a warning should be sent to governmental organizations and people within the danger area. Also a possibility of guidance should be provided when a flood is happening to assist rescuers and guide inhabitants to safe areas.

Basically the system will consist of four subsystems: monitor the state of dykes and water levels, analyze the data from the monitoring part to detect imminent floods, warn governmental organizations and inhabitants in the danger area, and provide guidance to search and rescue organizations and inhabitants.

The first subsystem (monitor the state of dykes and water levels) will consist of various sensors that are placed near and in dykes and water ways. The state of the dikes must be monitored continuously, i.e. pressure of the dyke. Also, sensors must be installed to monitored continuously the water level. The data of all the sensors will be sent to a server, in a safe location, to store all the data.

The second subsystem (analyze the data from the monitoring part to detect imminent floods) will analyze all the data from the sensors and data from weather forecasting service. Based on this data an algorithm will monitor continuously if there are dangerous situations.

The third subsystem (warn governmental organizations and inhabitants in the danger area) will send warning messages when the algorithm identified a dangerous situations. The safety region \ign{---in Dutch Veiligheidsregio--- }will receive a warning message that an area is in danger. Information like position, area, sort of danger and amount of danger will be send. The safety region will be responsible to take action based on this information. Inhabitants can receive warnings via sirens, mobile phone, radio, television, and by UAV.

The last subsystem (provides guidance to search and rescue organizations and inhabitants) It will help people that are in a dangerous area by sending them information on how to rescue themselves as in a save way. Rescue organizations  receive information about the area's that are likely to have casualties in them and it informs them on how to get to those locations save.

The service will consist of maintenance for the product and upgrades.

Floods will be the first natural disaster the initial system supports. The initial system sends warnings to the people in danger and to emergency services, but will not yet interact much with the user. However, the system doesn't stop there and will get increasingly more capabilities. The extra capabilities of system include:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Support for more kinds natural of disasters
		\item More individual guidance
		\item Interaction with the system, users can give input
		\item Support more sensor 
		\item Support of multiple communication networks to send information
	\end{itemize}

% We should discuss more about this

The first thing \CompanyName{} will focus on after the first release, is increasing the ability for the users to interaction with the system. This allows the system to provide more personal help to the users and increases knowledge the system has of the area. However, mistakes can easily be made by a user and so this data needs to be verified in order to get valuable information. That is why adding this feature goes beyond the scope of this project.

Adding sensor support is a continuous process. The sensors that are available are steadily increasing and their technology becomes more advanced. \CompanyName{} will monitor the sensor technologies and improvements to check if these can improve the system.
Depending on where the system resides, it will need to interact with various kinds of networks en media. Initially the flood warning system will focus on communicating with resources in the Netherlands. However, if a future release implements additional support for monitoring tornadoes or volcanoes, the system will most likely not be in the Netherlands.

\section{Target audience}
The target audience is where we focus on to market our product. The Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment is responsible for floods in the Netherlands. They make the decisions to buy the system. 

The Netherlands is divided into several safety regions. A safety region consists of all the emergency services, municipalities, water boards. They make decisions about how to make their region safer. All those organizations should be seen as the target audience. They must see the benefit of using \CompanyName{}'s Monitoring and Warning system.

\subsection{Software Architecture costs}
The software architecture team of \CompanyName consists of six members. Creating the architecture of the project is estimated to take ten weeks. All team members will spend 15 hours a week on the project. This totals $6*10*15=1050$ working hours. Each working hour costs \euro{}150,-. Total spend on the software architecture is \euro{}157.500

\subsection{Development costs}
The costs of developing the system is approximated in table \ref{table:develop-costs}, shown below.

\end{table}

Development of the system comprises the development of several different aspects. For each of these aspects, table \ref{table:develop-costs} shows an approximation of the hours needed for the development. Resulting in a total amount of $9770$ hours needed to create the system.\\
The development is done by \CompanyName self. Each member of the project team assigned to develop this system is paid $\euro{}50$ an hour. This results in a development cost of $50*9770=488.550$. As shown in the table below.

\label{table:total-dev-costs}
\end{table}

\subsection{Hardware costs}
Around 17,000 kilometres of dikes protect the Netherlands against flooding \cite{DMC}. 
Sensor costs include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item technical costs of the sensor
	\item implementation costs
	\item system implementation costs
\end{itemize}

The system needs:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Sensors
	\item {State monitor server}
	\item {Danger check server}	
	\item {Warning system server}	
	\item {Guidance server}	
\end{itemize}
The dykes contain a cross-section every 100m. To monitor the dykes accurately, 3 MEMS sensor modules(GeoBeads) are installed in each cross section. The sensors have an astimated life time of 10 years.
The sensors are installed using CPT push-in techniiques. 
%Spaargaren2012.pdf. p127, thank god.
\cite{UvAPHD} pp 127.
The monitoring system consists of MEMS sensor modules (e.g. GeoBeads) with a claimed life time of 10 years, which are installed with conventional CPT push-in techniques. Three sensors are installed per cross-section and a cross-section is installed every 100 m.
Each CPT push-in costs about \EUR{}200 per sensor (Feitsma,2002).
The total installation costs of monitoring system S1 are.

\begin{table}[H]
	\pgfplotstabletypeset[
		KeyValue
	]{%
		key & value &uom\\
		Total length of all dikes to be monitored & 7 & km \\
		Sensor cost & 350 & \EUR{}\\
		Instalment cost per sensor & 200 \EUR{}\\
		Distance between cross-sections  & 100 & m \\
		Sensors per cross-section & 3 \\
		Base installation cost factor & 0.2 & \\
		Period of investment & 10 & years \\
	}
	
This results in an installation cost of:
$$6\cdot(350+200)\cdot10\cdot3\cdot(1+0.2)=10090$$
\caption{Total costs of development}
\label{table:total-dev-costs}
\end{table}

The yearly maintenance and operation cost will be calculated as being a fraction of the instalment cost.\\
The yearly maintenance and operation costs is: 
$$0.1*10090\cdot0.1*10090$$ %
The total hardware costs then results in: \euro{}46.000

\subsection{Total costs}
The total costs for the system is calculated in the table below.\\
\newline
\pgfplotstabletypeset[%
Costs
]{%
	Description & Cost\\
	Software Architecture costs & \EUR{}157.500\\
	Development costs & $\euro{}$488.500\\
	Hardware costs & $\euro{}$46.000\\
	Total cost & $\euro{}$692.000\\
}
So the total costs for developing the system is \euro{}692.000\\

\section{Competitors}
Siemens is a competitor that already has developed a flood-warning system in Belgium in 2006. When the system detects a imminent flood it sends a SMS to people that live near the rivers in order to warn them. The system is implemented in a small region, which consists of only 3 rivers. The total cost for this system were \euro{}230.000. Later on they continued engineering the system. The system uses sensor which measures: temperature, water pressure, and shifting. They participated with this system in the Urban Flood project from the EU. The strong point of this competitor is that they already have funding and also experience with building such a system. Siemens is the main competitor for \CompanyName{}. Their strength is that they already have a proven system in Belgium and have a lot of experience through participating in flood monitoring research projects. The opportunity for \CompanyName{} is Engineering a flexible system that can be used in the future for other kind of disasters. Further on by selling the product at a low selling price and profit on the maintenance work and upgrades the Netherlands will be interesting in using the product.

Further there are Universities that do research on flood warning systems. At the Malaysian Institute Information Technology they developed a product prototype of a system called Intelligent Flood Information System via SMS. Waterlevel sensors are the only one they used. When their is a flood they send a warning SMS to people that are within the area. In the future this could become a competitor if they create a start-up or sell the idea to a company.
