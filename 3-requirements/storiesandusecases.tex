\section{Stories and use-cases}
This section will give an overview of the different use-cases. Figure \ref{fig:usecase-diagram} displays the use-case diagram. The diagram is made using the UML notation. In this diagram, we introduce the «after» notation to indicate that one use-case occurs after another use case in time. This provides an overview of the use-cases with their actors. In the subsections below, the architectural important use-cases are explained in more detail.
