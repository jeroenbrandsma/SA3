\section{Business opportunity}
There are many natural disasters happening each year all over the world. Each year these disasters take lives, waste a lot of property and money and cause social disturbance. It is expected that natural disasters will cause \$300 billion in losses annually in the upcoming decade. Climate change causes the natural disasters to get worse every year. Also the number of natural disasters has increased significantly since 1970.\\
Looking at, for example, the Indian ocean's tsunami in 2004, it looks that the damage could have been significantly reduced if the necessary people were warned. A system that would reduce the damage of natural disaster, could result in billions. \\
A system that warns and guides the people before or during the floods can result in billions being saved and will save allot of lives.

\section{Vision statement}
The Smart Flood Monitor will cause a revolutionary innovation on the environmental monitoring market. \CompanyName will offer a system which can detect floods early and correctly. This system helps us to enforce our vision, to limit the social and financial consequences of floods and avoid the loss of human lives. \\

\CompanyName will not be the only competitor on the environmental monitoring market. This means \CompanyName will have to take their own strength and weaknesses into account. If we combine these qualities with an analysis of the opportunities and weaknesses on the market, we should be able to become a core part of the future environmental monitoring systems.\\

Such an analysis is called a SWOT-analysis.

Our unique selling point is to provide a system with low selling price and high profit from the service contracts and upgrades.

\section{Business rationale}
\CompanyName will develop a new flood warning system in order to minimize the damage caused by a flood. In The Netherlands protection against floods is an important issue, because of the position under sea level. Global warming will increase the urgency of this issue. The people within the Netherlands must be well protected against floods. The flood warning system will detect floods, warn people and governmental institutions located in the disaster area and provide guidance where to go to. \todo{truncated}
\\
\CompanyName is new within the flood warning system market. By using sensors and automate the whole system a product will be launched which is reliable and adequate, but with the use of the newest technologies. \CompanyName will use hardware which is already on the market and is tested. Buying third party hardware will also speedup the development of the system and lower the costs\\

The product price will be low in order to get a market share and prove the product in a real-time environment. By providing maintenance and updates in the future \CompanyName will earn money to further improve the product and sell it to other potential customers. This in combination with the increased need of a reliable warning system for imminent floods will result in a viable business.\\


The unique selling point's of our system are: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item To provide a system with low selling price and high profit from the service contracts and upgrades.
	\item Warn the people in and around the area as soon as possible if the system is very certain that a flood is or will happen.
	\item Inform people about the details of the flood so the right preparations are made. 
	\item Inform people how to save themselves, others or goods.
\end{itemize}

This way, people will know when an area get's flooded, or when it's about to happen. People who requested it, will get informed on how to prepare for the flood and what to do during the flood.\\
These features are things that are be unique for our system and that will make successful. However, the project isn't yet successful when the system implemented these features. The main goal of this project is to safe lives, reduce costs and reduce social consequences. This will be satisfied when:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 80\% of the people in a dangerous area regarding a flood, receive a warning message. This message must contain enough information for receivers to know whether they are save or not and if not, how they can get to a save location.
	\item 80\% of the people who receive a warning successfully get to a safe environment in time.
	\item 80\% of the people receiving information before or during a flood, find these messages helpful and reported that it guided them successfully in order to save extra lives and/or goods.
\end{itemize}

\section{Business assumptions and dependencies}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \req{de}: The system uses the emergency services already in place by the government in order to message the citizens.
	
\end{itemize}

\section{Scope and limitations}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \req{fe}: Detect floods accurately
	\item \req{fe}: Predict floods using weather forecasts
	\item \req{fe}: The system can communicate with all necessary people.
	\item \req{fe}: The system correctly sends the right warnings and messages.
		
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Scope of Initial and subsequent releases}
%\todo{If you want to make this distinction you should mention the functionality of the first version too. Use some charts to show the progress during time from business and technical perspective.}

The initial release will only focus on floods as a natural disaster. The subsequent releases will further increase the different kinds of natural disasters that are supported by the system.\\

	\begin{itemize}
		\item More individual guidance
		\item Interaction with the system, users can give input
		\item More sensor support
		\item Using multiple communication networks to send information
	\end{itemize}

%\section{Business rationale}
\section{Product and service description}
\CompanyName offers a flood warning system. When a imminent flood is monitored by the sensors of the system a warning should be sent to governmental organizations and people within the danger area. Also guidance should be provided when a flood is happening to assist rescuers and guide inhabitants to safe areas.\\

Basically the system will consist of four subsystems: Monitor the state of dykes and water levels, monitor if a imminent flood is occurring, warn governmental organizations and inhabitants in the danger area, and provide guidance to search and rescue organizations and inhabitants.\\

The first subsystem, monitor the state of dykes and water levels, will consist of various sensors that are placed near and in dykes and water ways. The state of the dikes must be monitored continuously, i.e. pressure of the dyke. Also sensors must be installed to monitored continuously the water level. The data of all the sensors will be sent to a server, in a safe location, to store all the data.\\

The second subsystem, monitor if a imminent flood is occurring, will analyze all the data from the sensors and data from weather forecasting service. Based on this data an algorithm will monitor continuously if there are dangerous situations.\\

The third subsystem, warn governmental organizations and inhabitants in the danger area, will send warning messages when the algorithm identified a dangerous situations. The safety region, in Dutch Veiligheidsregio, will receive a warning message that an area is in danger. Information like place, sort danger and amount of danger will be send. The safety region will be responsible to take action based on this information. Inhabitants can receive warnings via sirens, mobile phone, radio, television, and by UA.\todo{truncated}

The last subsystem, provide guidance to search and rescue organizations and inhabitants, will help people that are in the danger area how to flee and rescue in a save way. Rescue organizations will receive information where are probably the most casualties and how to get safe to those locations.\\


The service will consist of maintenance for the product and upgrades.

\section{Target audience}
The Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment is the target customer. They have the responsibility in the government to identify unsafe situations caused by floods. When this ministry wants a new warning system they need to start a procurement. This gives the opportunity for various companies to bid on the procurement. At first the Dutch Ministry is our target audience, later on the product can be sold to other countries.

\section{Road maps}
The Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment will end the procurement of a flood warning system on 31-12-2015. The bid must consists of the design of the system and a financial analysis must be made. The engineering part of the system will be finished on 31-12-2016. An operating system is then up and running.

Directly after finishing the initial product, new features will be developed and can be sold.

After this first step there will tried to market the system to other countries in the world.
