\section{Risk assessment}
The system is confronted by several risks which are determined and mitigated in this section.
Taking thoses risks into account permits to avoid them or at least reduce their impact. \\
The risk management involves : the identifcation of the risks, their probability and potential impact or consequences.

\subsection{Techincal}

	\textbf{ T-RISK1 The warning system does not detect floods in time.} \\
	\textit{Probability of Occurence} : Low \\ %because the system is supposed to be realiable 
	%Timeframe
	\textit{Consequences}: Severe because of the loss of human lives and money (estimate how much ?),loss of credibility regarding the end-users.\\
	\textit{Prevention}: Make sure the number of sensors is sufficient and that they are in good state (as low failure rate as possible : repaire or replace them ) thanks to a weekly checking for example. \\
	And that the system is available and reliable : it has to be checked and tested often.\\
	\textit{Decision} \\
	

	\textbf{ T-RISK2 The system sends warnings of a non-excising flood (false positive.} \\
	\textit{Probability of Occurence} : Low \\
	%Timeframe
	\textit{Consequences}: Moderate . People become more negligent to future messages. \\
	\textit{Prevention}: UAV's watching the area where the supposed flood is.\\
	Hiring an operator to control . \\
	\textit{Decision}: Send a message as soon as the mistake is detected to tell the population it was a false alert. \\
	

	\textbf{ T-RISK3 The system can't send messages to the necessary people because the communication platform is also destroyed by the flood.} \\
	\textit{Probability of Occurence} :MEDIUM\\
	%Timeframe
	\textit{Consequences} : Severe . Loss of human lives and money .\\
	\textit{Prevention}: Find another way to get the phone number of a population (?). \\
	\textit{Decision} : Using other medias : television, radio, Intenet , ... \\
	

	\textbf{ T-RISK4 The system sends incorrect information, causing extra damage.} \\
	\textit{Probability of Occurence} :LOW\\
	%Timeframe
	\textit{Consequences} : High . Loss of money and maybe lives.\\
	\textit{Prevention}: Operator checking the validity of the information sent by the system.\\
	Good collaboration with the insurance companies. \\
	\textit{Decision}: \\

	\textbf{ T-RISK5 Hacker get access to the system} \\
	\textit{Probability of Occurence}:LOW \\
	\textit{Consequences} : High. The hackers may sent incorrect information deliberately during the flood : Loss of money and maybe human lives. The system isn't realiable anymore. \\
	\textit{Prevention}: Change password and hashcodes every six months. \\
	Hire specialists in the security field. \\
	\textit{Decision} : Update the security system / change it. Find a new algorithm for the creation of password and hascodes. \\


\subsection{Business}

	\textbf{ B-RISK1 Wrong estimation of the budget} \\
	\textit{Probability of Occurence} :Medium \\
	%Timeframe
	\textit{Consequences} : High . The final product hasn't the features expected. \\
	\textit{Prevention} : The team needs an accountant or at least someone taking care of the follow-up of the money. \\
	\textit{Decision} : Remove some requirements or features of the product. \\

	\textbf{ B-RISK2 The money invested in the fabrication and achievement of the product/system isn't "covered" by the sales (shortfall/deficit)} \\
	\textit{Probability of Occurence}:Medium \\
	%Timeframe
	\textit{Consequences}: High .Stopping the sale \\
	\textit{Prevention}: 
	\textit{Decision} : Adding more features to the product in order to make it more competitive in the market. \\
	

	\textbf{ B-RISK3 Competitors lowering their prices so our company has to reduce its} \\
	\textit{Probability of Occurence}: Medium \\
	%Timeframe
	\textit{Consequences} : Moderate . Loss of money \\
	\textit{Prevention} \\
	\textit{Decision} \\
	
	\textbf{ B-RISK4 The sensors company become bankrupt} \\
	\textit{Probability of Occurence}: Low \\
	\textit{Consequences}: High.\\
	\textit{Prevention} Our system use sensors from different companies \\
	\textit{Decision}: Find another company selling sensors and make sure of its reliability. \\


\subsection{Schedule}

	\textbf{ S-RISK1 The project isn't finished at the deadline} \\
	\textit {Probability of Occurence}  : Low
	%Timeframe
	\textit{Consequences} : Pressure for all the team members, loss of credibility regarding the end-users, selling a product with less fetures than expected.\\
	\textit{Prevention} : Meeting for the team members every week to keep track of the timing and take decisions according to the deadline. \\
	\textit{Decision} : Remove some requirements or features in order to finish the project as soon as possible.\\
