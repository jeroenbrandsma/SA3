\chapter{Requirements}
\label{ch:requirements}
This chapter will describe the vision and use it to derive stakeholders to be able to properly write use cases and stories. These will be used to extract functional, commercial, technical and evolution requirements. Afterwards, a risk assessment will take place, to ensure that the project is not at great risk.

% GK: Im all for dropping evolution requirements, as there are hardly any metrics to measure it, while it's also quite hard to already define what's going to happen to the project after development. Also; it's not in the example, so where does this even come from? Evolution could be handled in a seperate chapter, but that should be more about ideas, rather than about requirements.
