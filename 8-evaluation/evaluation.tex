\chapter{Architecture evaluation}
\label{ch:evaluation}
In this chapter the software architecture will be evaluated. This document started with a requirement analysis. The requirements which are defined in chapter 3 are checked if they are fulfilled in the software architecture. Another part in this chapter is the architecture evaluation using Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM). The architectural risks can be exposed that can harm the organization's business goals.

\section{Requirements validation}
The requirements from chapter 3 are evaluated in this section. The section is split according to chapter 3. First  the functional requirements, following the commercial requirements, and at the end the technical non-functional requirements.
