\section{Software design decisions}
\label{sec:softdecisions}

This section highlights some of the software design decisions that have been made, especially those that are not covered in the previous views.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% DECISIONS TO MAKE
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Data Mapper for the data layer.
%alternatives: table data gateway, active record, ...
	
%Push/pull from sensors: 	Push model reduces the server load. No requests so no high load. No data management, no security management. No DOS. 
%							Downside: Data will be received that was not requested, even if not interested. 
%
%Update monitor system firmware? Is this needed? Do we do this? And how do we do this?
%Do sensors have firmware and how do we update that?
%
%How to controll the uav? Manually or auto pilot? (see Auto flight: (105.pdf p110): 4.3 Manual versus autonomous flight)
%
%How to process the uav data. Maybe: Pix4D software automatically processes terrestrial and aerial imagery acquired by light-weight drones or aircraft using its innovative technology based purely on image 	content. This desktop software converts your images into highly precise, timely and customizable results for a wide range of GIS and CAD applications.

%TODO (HMAC should be a decision, could also use other hashes and verification)

		\textbf{Arguments} 		&
			\textbf{Table data gateway} The table data gateway is a pattern that, for each domain class, provides a gateway class. This gateway class provides methods to that do all the database interaction. This way all the SQL statements will be stored in the gateway class and thus is separated from the domain layer. \\\\
			& \textbf{Row gateway} Same idea as the table data gateway, but now for individual rows, instead of a table. \\\\

		\textbf{Arguments}     &               
		\textbf{Unique token}
		A hash-function is used, taking as input the sensor data and a unique token, producing an output hash, which can be used to verify the data is from the sensor. The downside of using a unique token is that, when compromised, it requires updating the token on all the sensors. \\\\
		& \textbf{Per-sensor token}
		Instead of a single token, all the sensors will have their own unique token. This allows revoking the token of an individual sensor.
		This requires the central server to have a list of all the tokens. It however, allows the server to revoke one of the tokens if a sensor gets compromised. \\\\
		& \textbf{VPN}
		A VPN (Virtual Private Network) allows all the sensors and the central server to be in the same virtual network. Access to the VPN requires authentication. This means a secure private network is created. However, the Arduinos which are responsible for sending the sensor data will most likely have problems using a VPN because of their limited CPU and memory.
