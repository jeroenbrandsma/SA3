Assumptions:
\noindent{
	\begin{itemize}
	  \item People requesting guidance have access to a phone that is either connected 		to a mobile network or to the internet
	  \item The system is able to monitor various kinds of sensors
	  \item The system has access to the internet
	  \item The sensors are (in some way) connected to the system
	  \item The system is able to use various kinds of sensors in order to predict floods.
	  \item When the system has enough proof of a flood, the users will be informed in a timely manner (within 30 seconds maximal).
	  \item People within a range of (30km?) will be warned about a detected flood
	  \item The system uses multiple weather forecasting services to make its own predictions about possible upcoming floods.
	\end{itemize}
}

\attention{
In what ways will the system detect a flood? Sensors, UAV’s, forecasting?\\
How to detect a flood based on the forecasting? Warn beforehand? Pay extra attention to the new upcoming flood by sending extra robots/uav's?
}

Decision:
Security? (What if someone tries to manipulate a sensor?)\\
One or multiple warning systems (failover)\\
Networking? Redundancy of cables (trunked?)\\
When to alarm? What to do if only 1 sensor warns about a flood?\\
Security decisions?\\
