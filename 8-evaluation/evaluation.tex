\chapter{Architecture evaluation}
\label{ch:evaluation}
In this chapter the software architecture will be evaluated. This document started with a requirement analysis. The requirements which are defined in chapter 3 are checked if they are fulfilled in the software architecture. Another part in this chapter is the architecture evaluation using Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM). The architectural risks can be exposed that can harm the organization's business goals.

%\input{8-evalutation/requirementsverification.tex}
The requirements from chapter 3 are evaluated in this section. The section is split according to chapter 3. First  the functional requirements, following the commercial requirements, and at the end the technical non-functional requirements.

The ATAM method is used to evaluate the software architecture. The purpose of ATAM is elicit and refine a precise statement of the architecture’s driving quality attribute requirements
• elicit and refine a precise statement of the architectural design decisions
• evaluate the architectural design decisions to determine if they satisfactorily address the
quality requirements [add source]
%/ source: Using the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method to Evaluate a Wargame Simulation System: A Case Study Lawrence G. Jones Anthony J. Lattanze December 2001 Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Initiative 

The method consists of the following steps:[add source]
1. Present the ATAM: The evaluation team presents a quick overview of the ATAM steps,
techniques used, and outputs from the process.
2. Present the business drivers: The system manager briefly presents the business drivers
and context for the architecture. 
3. Present the architecture: The architect presents an overview of the architecture.
4. Identify architectural approaches: Itemize the architectural decisions discovered in the
previous step.
5. Generate the quality attribute utility tree: Identify, prioritize, and refine the most
important quality attribute goals in a utility tree format.
6. Analyze architectural approaches: Probe the architectural approaches in light of the
quality attributes in order to identify risks, sensitivity points, and tradeoffs.
7. Brainstorm and prioritize scenarios: Create and analyze scenarios that represent the
various stakeholders’ interests to understand quality attribute requirements and their
relative importance.
8. Analyze architectural approaches: Continue to identify risks, sensitivity points, and
tradeoffs while noting the impact of each scenario on the architectural approaches.
9. Present results: Recapitulate the ATAM steps, outputs, and recommendations.

The first three steps are presented in the previous chapters. In this sub-chapter the focus will be on step 4 and further.
