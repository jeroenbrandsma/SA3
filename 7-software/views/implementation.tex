\subsection{Implementation view}
\label{subsec:implementview}

\copied{The development view illustrates a system from a programmer's perspective and is concerned with software management. This view is also known as the implementation view. It uses the UML Component diagram to describe system components. UML Diagrams used to represent the development view include the Package diagram.}

The implementation view, also known as the development view, describes the system from the programmer's perspective. This includes a description of the components of the system and how the system is packaged.  

\subsubsection{Components}
\label{subsubsec:components}
The system consists of a set of components that all interact with each other. In figure~\ref{fig:component} below, these different components are shown. Each component can provide interfaces and uses sockets to connect to interfaces of other components. This way, the implementation of each component can independently be replaced and deployed.

	\label{fig:component}
\end{figure}

There components are placed in three layers. The data source  layer, domain layer and service source layer.

In the data source layer the data is stored and the data mapper. It consist of two components. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item ElasticSearchDatabase: This is the database that holds all the stored data of the system.
	\item DataMapper: This component is responsible for reading from the database and adding new data.
\end{itemize}

In the domain layer the business rules and logic is placed. The following components are placed:
\begin{itemize}
	\item DomainObject: Responsible for managing the data streams with the database
	\item UserManager: Responsible for gathering the user data and normalizing
	\item DataProvider: Responsible for obtaining the data the REST server requests
	\item SensorManager: Component that is used for installing, update and delete sensors and retrieving data from the sensors
	\item Algorithms: Component used for algorithms that calculate the flood probability
	\item DomainController: Responsible for the data streams with the service layer
	\item ExternalData: Gets external data that is used to calculate the flood probability
\end{itemize}

In the Service layer the services are included used by external actors. The following components are included:
\begin{itemize}
	\item RESTServer: Server which communicates with external software
	\item MessageDistribution: Component responsible for distributing warning messages to external parties.
	\end{itemize}
	
Outside the layer are external software components:
\begin{itemize}
	\item SMSService: Component to let citizen subscribe for warning texts and receive warning texts.
	\item SafetyRegion: Component to which the system communicates to in order to warn the Safety region.
	\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Packages}
The software of the system is divided into several packages. These packages and their relations can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:package-diagram}. 
In this diagram, «use» depicts the use of an interface exposed by a software package, «access» depicts a private import of (parts of) another package, while «import» means a public import of (parts of) another package. 

The diagram contains software packages of the system itself, as well as software packages provided by third parties. The software packages provided by third parties are drawn outside of the `Smart Flood Monitoring System'-box.

The `Third Party API' is the software package which exposes a REST-API, which can be used by third parties to query data from the system.
The `External Data' is the software package which uses APIs from other systems to query data, like weather and geographic data.

	\caption{Package diagram}
	\label{fig:package-diagram}
\end{figure}

The following packages are in the system.
	\begin{itemize}
	 \item Sensor Software: This software package is used for retrieving data from the sensors. It uses the sensor manager.
	 \item Sensor Manager: Responsible for installing sensors and configure the sensors.
	 \item Data Abstraction: Holds all data that is stored in the system.
	 \item Third Party API: Package that enables third party software too access data from the system database.
	 \item External Data: This package retrieves data from the GEO API, Weather API and Demographic API.
	 \item Monitoring \& Flood detection: Access the data from database and calculates if a flood is imminent. 
	 \item Warning: When a flood is imminent the warning package is used to send out a warning.
	\end{itemize}

The following external packages are used:
\begin{itemize}
	\item SMS Service: This package is used to let citizen subscribe to the warning services and send out warnings.
	\item Safety region API: When a flood is imminent a warning is send by the system to the safety region API package.
	\item GEO/Weather/Demographic API, these software packages are API's provided by third parties.
\end{itemize}
