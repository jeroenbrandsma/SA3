\chapter{Analysis}
\label{ch:analysis}
This chapter describes the analysis. It lists the assumptions made about the system and it's environment. Next, an overview of the high-level design decisions is given.

\section{Assumptions}
There are several assumptions made about the system and it's environment:

\noindent{
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item The safety region / government has means to alert citizens in an area to evacuate.
	  \item The safety region is informed about our system and will alert citizens if needed when our system alerts the safety region.
	  \item People who are subscribed for flood warnings/guidance have a mobile phone that can receive text messages and MMS.
	  \item Sensors can be placed in the water ways and dikes in locations where they can provide representative measurements.
	  \item Information is available to the system with regards to the population density and terrain height in different areas.
	  \item A flood will not reach further than 50 km. % see SEC-7
	  \item Supplying information about the areas affected by the flood in a resolution of 5 by 5 km (as described in \ref{fr:10}) is sufficient for the government/safety region to make decisions regarding alerting and evacuating citizens.
	  \item It is possible to predict the expected water level up to 12 hours in the future.
	  \item A weather forecasting API is available that provides precipitation and wind data.
	  \item The sensors are (in some way) connected to the system.
	  \item The safety region provides an API, which can be used by the system to warn the safety region.
	\end{enumerate}

\section{High-level Design Decisions}
This section discusses the high-level design decisions.

Each decision is explained in a table. The arguments section of the table lists for each alternative a score for every important quality attribute.
A higher score means a more favourable result. For example, a high score for costs means a low cost for the system.

%\noindent{
%	\begin{itemize}
%	\item Security? (What if someone tries to manipulate a sensor?)
%	\item One or multiple warning systems (failover)
%	\item Networking? Redundancy of cables (trunked?)
%	\item When to alarm? What to do if only 1 sensor warns about a flood?
%	\item Security decisions?
%	\item Operating system decision
%	\item Storage decision
%	\item Push or pull updates? (Pushing I’m hoping)
%	\item Programming language(s) for the system? Web-interface, sensor monitoring, weather forecasting system, push notification system
%	\item In what ways will the system detect a flood? Sensors, UAV’s, forecasting?
%	\item How to detect a flood based on the forecasting? Warn beforehand? Pay extra attention to the new upcoming flood by sending extra robots/uav's?

 \textbf{Decision} 		& \textbf{DEC-}\textbf{\nextNrRef{dn}} \\ \midrule \midrule
 \textbf{Problem/Issue} 	& To measure the water level in the water ways and along the coast, a sensor is needed to measure the water level. \\ \midrule
 \textbf{Decision} 		& The system will use pressure sensors to measure the water level. Pressure sensors are submerged at a fixed level in the water body. By measuring the pressure on the sensor of the water above it, these types of sensors are able to determine the water level. \\ \midrule
 \textbf{Alternatives} 	
    					  &\textit{Float-operated sensor}\\ 
    					    & These types of sensors are mechanical and have a floating element which can move up and down with the water level. The floating element is protected in a `stilling well' and therefore, the risk of damage is low.  \\
    					  &\textit{Non-contact sensor}\\
    					    & These types of sensors use (ultra)sonic waves to determine the water level. Sediment in the water can cause issues with the measurements.\\
    					  &\textit{Bubbler sensors}\\
    					    & Bubbler sensors can measure the water level by measuring the pressure needed to force an air bubble through a submerged tube. Bubbler sensors have good resistance against damage from floods and debris. \\
    					    % http://www.fondriest.com/news/flowlevelmeasurements.htm
\textbf{Arguments} 		& For this decision the interoperability and security have a weight of 0, because those depend on the specific sensor used and not on the type of sensor. Scalability was not taken into account because this depends mostly on the costs of the type of sensor.\\
