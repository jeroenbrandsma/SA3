\section{Evolution requirements}

When establishing the project, architects of the system listed a certain number of requirements which describe the features of the system. However, due to environmental changes and changing stakeholders interests, for example, the requirements may evolve. \\

	\reqRow{ER}{Adding of external input}{Citizens can contribute to the guidance by giving extra information (for example if they identified a safe route near their location). This information can be checked by an operator (thanks to photograph by the UAVs for example) .  Functionality can be added to the system in the future, that can take citizen feedback into account to get more information about the current flood}. 
	
	%\reqRow{ER}{New sensors}{The system is able to work with new sensors technologies, which are coming on the market over the years}.
	
	%\reqRow{ER} {Improving algorithms for detecting a flood} {New algorithms may become available, which have a better accuracy for the flood prediction described in \ref{fr:detect-flood}. The part of the system with the flood prediction algorithm has to be modular, so that it can be replaced with an improved algorithm, once such an algorithm becomes available.}
