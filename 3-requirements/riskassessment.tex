\begin{itemize}

	\item \req{ri}: The system sends warnings of a non-excising flood (false positive), making people more negligent to future messages.
	\item \req{ri}: The system can't send messages to the necessary people because the communication platform is also destroyed by the flood.
	\item \req{ri}: The system sends incorrect information, causing extra damage.
