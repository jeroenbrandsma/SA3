%Typical change-cases with respect to the environement, the features and the technology of the system
%http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/changeCase.htm
When establishing the project, architects of the system listed a certain number of requirements which describe the features of the system. But due to environmental changes and end-users requests the requirements evolve.

\textbf{ER-1 Changes in the display of the map } \\
\textit { Evolution of FR-19 } Citizens who subscribed for flood warnings get a map with specific route information (according to their location) to a safe area through the API (in association with Google Map). \\

\textbf{ER-2 : Adding of external input} Citizens can contribute to the guidance by giving extra information(for example if they identified a safe route near their location) but this information will be checked by an operator (thanks to photograph by the UAV's for example). \\

\textbf{ER-3 : New OS } The system is able to work with other operating systems than Linux, for example Windows and MacOS. %Portability

%\textbf{ER-3} The system is able to work on several mobile devices platforms : Android, iOs, Windows Phone. \\ IN CASE OF AN APP

\textbf{ER-4 : New sensors } The system is able to work with new sensors technologies, which are coming on the market over the years.
