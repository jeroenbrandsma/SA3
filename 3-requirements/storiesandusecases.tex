% \subsection{A citizen reports an obstruction}
% \textbf{Scope:} Monitoring part of the system\\\\
% \textbf{Level:} Main process\\\\
% \textbf{Primary actor:} Citizen\\\\
% \textbf{Stakeholders and interests:}\\
% 	1. Citizen - A citizen wants to report an obstruction to make the guidance part more reliable. \\\\
% \textbf{Preconditions:} There is an obstruction which is not yet reported. \\
% \textbf{Postconditions:} There is an obstruction which is reported by a citizen and is known in the system. \\\\
% \textbf{Main succes scenario:} \\
% 1 - There is an obstruction somewhere in the area. \\
% 2 - The citizen opens our application on his smartphone. \\
% 3 - The citizen reports the kind of obstruction and the location. \\
% 4 - The system gets the obstruction information as input. \\
% 5 - The obstruction is processed in the system and visible to other citizens. \\\\
% \textbf{Extensions:} \\
% 3a - The citizen doesn't know the location, GPS can be used in this case. If GPS doesn't work, the obstruction can't be reported. \\
% 4a - The smartphone can't send the information. In this case, the obstruciton can't be reported.
