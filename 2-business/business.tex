\chapter{Architectural business information}
\label{ch:business}
The following section describes the different aspects of the business environment of the Smart Flood Monitor. First we will explain our vision and why there is place for us at the market. After this the product and its customers will be explained. This chapter is completed with a more detailed look at the business model and some models about the market and the financial prospect.

\section{Business opportunity}
There are many natural disasters happening each year all over the world. Each year these disasters take lives, waste a lot of property and money and cause social disturbance. It is expected that natural disasters will cause \$300 billion in losses annually in the upcoming decade. Climate change causes the natural disasters to get worse every year. Also the number of natural disasters has increased significantly since 1970.\\
Looking at, for example, the Indian ocean's tsunami in 2004, it looks that the damage could have been significantly reduced if the necessary people were warned. A system that would reduce the damage of natural disaster, could result in billions. \\
A system that warns and guides the people before or during the floods can result in billions being saved and will save allot of lives.

\section{Vision statement}
The Smart Flood Monitor will cause a revolutionary innovation on the environmental monitoring market. \CompanyName will offer a system which can detect floods early and correctly. This system helps us to enforce our vision, to limit the social and financial consequences of floods and avoid the loss of human lives. \\

\CompanyName will not be the only competitor on the environmental monitoring market. This means \CompanyName will have to take their own strength and weaknesses into account. If we combine these qualities with an analysis of the opportunities and weaknesses on the market, we should be able to become a core part of the future environmental monitoring systems.\\

Such an analysis is called a SWOT-analysis. 

Strengths: Diverse team with several skills in IT and management. Experience with working with sensors.\\ 
Weaknesses: No experience with creating such system. No knowledge of floods. The product is a complex system.\\
Opportunities: Due to climate change, the market will grow and such a system becomes more urgent. Few competitors in the market. Smart sensors are a hot topic, new sensors will be developed.\\
Threats: High production costs. Competitors will enter the market because of growing market. Climate change will force to improve the system over time.\\

Our unique selling point is to provide a system with low selling price and high profit from the service contracts and upgrades.

\section{Business rationale}
\CompanyName will develop a new flood warning system in order to minimize the damage caused by a flood. In The Netherlands protection against floods is an important issue, because of the position under sea level. Global warming will increase the urgency of this issue. The people within the Netherlands must be well protected against floods. The flood warning system will detect floods, warn people and governmental institutions located in the disaster area and provide guidance where to go to. \todo{truncated}
\\
\CompanyName is new within the flood warning system market. By using sensors and automate the whole system a product will be launched which is reliable and adequate, but with the use of the newest technologies. \CompanyName will use hardware which is already on the market and is tested. Buying third party hardware will also speedup the development of the system and lower the costs.\\

The product price will be low in order to get a market share and prove the product in a real-time environment. By providing maintenance and updates in the future \CompanyName will earn money to further improve the product and sell it to other potential customers. This in combination with the increased need of a reliable warning system for imminent floods will result in a viable business.\\


The unique selling point{'}s of our system are: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item To provide a system with low selling price and high profit from the service contracts and upgrades.
	\item Warn the people in and around the area as soon as possible if the system is very certain that a flood is or will happen.
	\item Inform people about the details of the flood so the right preparations are made. 
	\item Inform people how to save themselves, others or goods.
\end{itemize}

This way, people will know when an area get{'}s flooded, or when it's about to happen. People who requested it, will get informed on how to prepare for the flood and what to do during the flood.\\
These features are things that are be unique for our system and that make it successful. The main goal of this project, however, is to safe lives, reduce costs and reduce social consequences. These main goals will be met when:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item 80\% of the people in a dangerous area regarding a flood, receive a warning message. This message must contain enough information for receivers to know whether they are save or not and if not, how they can get to a save location.
	\item 80\% of the people who receive a warning successfully get to a safe environment in time.
	\item 80\% of the people receiving information before or during a flood, find these messages helpful and reported that it guided them successfully in order to save extra lives and/or goods.
\end{enumerate}

When the first version of \ProjectName is release and is used to start monitoring actual floods, it's success will be measured according these statistics. Getting a warning message to the people who need to be warned is the most important. Using this warning message, people can move to a saver location.

\subsection{Scope of Initial and subsequent releases}
%\todo{If you want to make this distinction you should mention the functionality of the first version too. Use some charts to show the progress during time from business and technical perspective.}

The initial release will only focus on floods as a natural disaster. It will send warnings to the necessary people, but will not yet interact much with the user. The system, however, doesn't stop there, and will get increasingly more capabilities. The extra capabilities of system include:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Support for more kinds natural disasters
		\item More individual guidance
		\item Interaction with the system, users can give input
		\item Adding more sensor support
		\item Using multiple communication networks to send information
	\end{itemize}

The first thing \CompanyName Will focus on after the first release, is to let users interact with the system more. This will allow the system to have better knowledge of the area. However, mistakes can easily be made by a user and so this data needs to be verified in order to get valuable information. That's why adding this feature goes beond the scope of this project.\\
Adding sensor support is a continuous process. The sensors that are available is steadily increasing and their technology becomes more advanced. \CompanyName will monitor the sensor technologies and improvements to check if these can improve the system. \\
Depending on where the system resides, it will need to interact with various kinds of networks en media. Initially the flood warning system will focus on communicating with resouces in the netherlands. However, if a future release implements additional support for monitoring tornado' or vulcano', the system will most likely not be in the netherlans

%\section{Business rationale}
\section{Product and service description}
\CompanyName offers a flood warning system. When a imminent flood is monitored by the sensors of the system a warning should be sent to governmental organizations and people within the danger area. Also guidance should be provided when a flood is happening to assist rescuers and guide inhabitants to safe areas.\\

Basically the system will consist of four subsystems: Monitor the state of dykes and water levels, monitor if a imminent flood is occurring, warn governmental organizations and inhabitants in the danger area, and provide guidance to search and rescue organizations and inhabitants.\\

The first subsystem, monitor the state of dykes and water levels, will consist of various sensors that are placed near and in dykes and water ways. The state of the dikes must be monitored continuously, i.e. pressure of the dyke. Also sensors must be installed to monitored continuously the water level. The data of all the sensors will be sent to a server, in a safe location, to store all the data.\\

The second subsystem, monitor if a imminent flood is occurring, will analyze all the data from the sensors and data from weather forecasting service. Based on this data an algorithm will monitor continuously if there are dangerous situations.\\

The third subsystem, warn governmental organizations and inhabitants in the danger area, will send warning messages when the algorithm identified a dangerous situations. The safety region, in Dutch Veiligheidsregio, will receive a warning message that an area is in danger. Information like place, sort danger and amount of danger will be send. The safety region will be responsible to take action based on this information. Inhabitants can receive warnings via sirens, mobile phone, radio, television, and by UAV.\todo{truncated}

The last subsystem, provide guidance to search and rescue organizations and inhabitants, will help people that are in the danger area how to flee and rescue in a save way. Rescue organizations will receive information where are probably the most casualties and how to get safe to those locations.\\


The service will consist of maintenance for the product and upgrades.

\section{Target audience}
The Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment is the target customer. They have the responsibility in the government to identify unsafe situations caused by floods. When this ministry wants a new warning system they need to start a procurement. This gives the opportunity for various companies to bid on the procurement. At first the Dutch Ministry is our target audience, later on the product can be sold to other countries.
