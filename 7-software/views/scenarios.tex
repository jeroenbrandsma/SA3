\subsection{Scenarios}
\copied{Scenarios : The description of an architecture is illustrated using a small set of use cases, or scenarios which become a fifth view. The scenarios describe sequences of interactions between objects, and between processes. They are used to identify architectural elements and to illustrate and validate the architecture design. They also serve as a starting point for tests of an architecture prototype. This view is also known as use case view.\\
\\
Scenarios are putting it all together. Interaction between objects in the
system is expressed by object interaction and scenario diagrams as shown on
Figure 6.
