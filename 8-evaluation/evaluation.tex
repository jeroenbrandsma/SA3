\chapter{Architecture evaluation}

\label{ch:evaluation}
In this chapter the software architecture will be evaluated. This document started with a requirement analysis. The requirements which are defined in chapter 3 are checked if they are fulfilled in the software architecture. Another part in this chapter is the architecture evaluation using Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM). The architectural risks can be exposed that can harm the organization's business goals.

\section{Requirements validation}

A summary of the verification of the requirements from chapter 3 is given in this section. A table in which all the requirements get verified individually, can be found in appendix \ref{append:reqeval}.\\
The requirements validation shows that the functional requirements are met with this architecture. For the non-functional requirements there are a few requirements that have the status unknown, meaning there were complications in the verification.

%The requirements from chapter 3 are evaluated in this section. The section is split according to chapter 3. First the functional requirements, following the commercial requirements, and at the end the technical non-functional requirements.
