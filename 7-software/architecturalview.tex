\section{Architectural view}
The following section will elaborate the views of the system into 4+1 Model: logical view, implementation view, process view, and deployment view.

\subsection{Logical View}
This view shows the structural elements, key abstractions and mechanisms that are used within HPS to realize the systemics functionality. At first an overview of the components is provided. After that the main components are decomposed and desired in term of responsibilities and interfaces. In the end, the variability guide mentions parts of the software, which clarification is deferred until development/design phase.

\subsection{Implementation View}
This view deals with, for example, code organization Configuration, building operating system, data base, and middle ware.

\subsection{Process View}
This view mainly discuss about runtime, concurrency, communication, and synchronization of the process running in the system.

\subsection{Deployment View}
This subsection outlines physical distribution of hardware and software, typically the topology of the system.
