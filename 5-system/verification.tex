\section{Verification}
The feasibility of the \ProjectName{} is verified in the following section.

\subsection{Reliability}
To determine the reliability of the system we determine the reliability of the separate components. Let:\\
MTBF: Mean Time Between Failure\\
MTTR: Mean Time To Repair \\
The reliability of the complete system is given as $x$\\
$x = {MTBF \over{MTBF + MTTR}}$

\subsection{Time to Market}
All external services already excist. 

\subsection{Cost}
Cost of API's we use for our system.
