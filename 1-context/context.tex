\chapter{System Context}
\label{ch:context}

\CompanyName. is a software architecture team that is specialized in making smart systems for environmental monitoring

All around the world, natural disasters cause a lot of trouble. These disasters can result in catastrophic events that cause deaths and require a huge amount of money to repair the damages caused. People lack the knowledge on when the disaster is about to happen, how to properly prepare and how to properly act during such a disaster.

Climate change and extreme weather phenomena cause these disasters to get worse over time. Every year the amount of these disasters increases and they become increasingly more severe. This causes the damage of the natural disasters to increase, which means that there is a great need for a system that can reduce this damage and helps the people during natural disasters like these. The system that developed aims to do this.
The goal of our first product is to:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item save lives,
	\item reduce damage costs,
	\item reduce the social consequences.
\end{enumerate}

To achieve the aforementioned goals, the system will provide predictions with regard to upcoming floods.

The first release of this system that we, as the architecting team of \CompanyName design, will only support floods as a natural disaster. The system will provide warnings and guidance to the necessary people before and during a flood. By using various kinds of sensors, like vehicles and control units, this system monitors certain areas. If something suspicious happens, the system will check and verify the information in order to not give false flood warnings. When a flood indeed occurs (or will occur), the system provides warnings and guidance to the necessary people during and, if possible, before a flood. Also a warning will be send to the safety region, an organization that consists of the mayor of the region, emergency services, water boards and the army. 

When this flood monitoring system works as planned and shows that it can indeed reduce the damage of floods, \CompanyName will extend the systems functionality  by adding support for the monitoring of other kinds of natural disasters and situations that desire a monitoring system.

Over time, the system will reduce social, financial and human losses of natural disasters, starting with floods. This will revolutionize the way how is thought about natural disasters. Though the market around environmental monitoring is very competitive, this system aims at being a core part of future monitoring systems by being as dynamic and flexible as possible. Thereby allowing new features to be added easily, allowing the system to grow over time, including new upcoming user needs.
