\section{Risk assessment}
<<<<<<< HEAD
The system is confronted by several risks which are determined and mitigated in this section.
=======
The system is confronted by severals risks which are determined and mitigated in this section.
The risk management involves : the identifcation of the risks, their probability and potential impact or consequences.

% The sensors company become bankrupt \\
