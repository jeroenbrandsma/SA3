\chapter{System evolution}

\label{ch:evolution}
In the previous chapters the system design is documented and evaluated. In this chapter future functions for the system are explained. These improvements will be made in order to stay ahead of the competition by using the newest technologies.

\section{Other countries}
This system is first designed for the Netherlands. The Netherlands is used as a starting point for designing such a system because they thrive to have the newest technologies for water protection. But FMS is designed in such a way that it can be used in other countries. When is proven that in real live the FMS is working properly marketing the system to other countries will start.

\section{Third party guidance evolution}
Third party application companies will use the API that is provided in order to provide guidance or other services. Close connections with those companies should be hold in order to now what kind of data they need in order to create service that will contribute to the safety when there are imminent floods. 

\section{Other disasters}
There are different kind of disasters happening over the worlds which cause tremendous damage and harm to people and their belongings. For other kind of disasters other kind of sensors can be installed and calculations with different algorithms can detect other disasters, like earthquakes or volcano eruptions. This will be done in close collaboration with third party application developers.

\section{UAV evolution}
UAV's are used in order to check faulty sensors and which area's are flooded. In the future the UAV's will be used in order to spot citizens that need help and guide them or alert emergency services in order to rescue them. 

\section{Wireless network connection} 
At this moment it the best solution for communication is wired network. Right now improvements are made in wireless network communication. LoRa (Long range radio) could be used for data transfers. For this type of communication a low amount of energy is used and the sensor can transfer data when it is in there range of 10 kilometer.

\section{Satellite}
Using satellites, real time images can be used in order to see what the results are when there is a flood. This makes it easier to guide people to saver area's and assist emergency services. Even pictures could be made to check the state of a dyke.
