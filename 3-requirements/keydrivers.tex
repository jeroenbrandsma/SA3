\section{Key-drivers}

\autoref{table:stakeholder_concern} has shown the concerns of the stakeholders of our system. Not every stakeholder is equally the same in our system. Each stakeholder receives 100 points to be distributed to all quality attributes, but is also assigned a weight. By doing this, important quality attributes can be determined and those will be the key-drivers of our system.

It is clear that \textbf{reliability} is by far the most important quality attribute of our system, followed by \textbf{availability} as the second most important, and \textbf{performance} as the third most important quality attribute. Thus, those three quality attributes will be the \textit{key-drivers} of our system. We decided to choose only three quality attributes as the key drivers for our system because choosing more than three may possibly drive our system architecture to be more complex and consume more time to be developed.
