\section{Risk assessment}
The system is confronted by several risks which are determined and mitigated in this section.

\begin{longtable}{L{0.1\textwidth} L{0.0\textwidth} L{0.7\textwidth}}
	\textbf{Nr.} &  & \textbf{Description} \\
	\reqRow{risk}{1}{}{The warning system does not detect floods in time}
	\reqRow{risk}{2}{}{The system sends warnings of a non-excising flood (false positive), making people more negligent to future messages.}
	\reqRow{risk}{3}{}{The system can't send messages to the necessary people because the communication platform is also destroyed by the flood.}
	\reqRow{risk}{4}{}{The system sends incorrect information, causing extra damage.}
	\reqRow{risk}{5}{}{Hacker get access to the system} % is this riskworthy?
	\reqRow{risk}{6}{}{The sensors company become bankrupt}
	\reqRow{risk}{7}{}{Competitors lowering their prices} % is this riskworthy?
	\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

% False positive GK: Is this really a risk?
% Failure ( how many sensors could be damaged and the system still working ? percentage ... ) \\ GK: This is already covered by the tnfr
% The sensors company become bankrupt \\
% Reducing the price because of competition \\

% HOW TO HANDLE THOSE RISKS ? 

% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item \req{ri}: The warning system does not detect floods in time
% 	\item \req{ri}: The system sends warnings of a non-excising flood (false positive), making people more negligent to future messages.
% 	\item \req{ri}: The system can't send messages to the necessary people because the communication platform is also destroyed by the flood.
% 	\item \req{ri}: The system sends incorrect information, causing extra damage.
